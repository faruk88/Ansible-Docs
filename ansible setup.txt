login as normal user  (say student user):

We will execute command in managed node using devops user

Make one directory
$mkdir /home/student/ansible-demo
$cd  /home/student/ansible-demo
$vim ansible.cfg
[defaults]

inventory = hosts
remote_user = devops

[privilege_escalation]

become = true
become_method = sudo
become_user =root
become_ask_pass = false

$vim hosts

managed01.example.com
managed02.example.com

[web]
managed01
[app]
managed02

$ssh-keygen -t rsa
blank enter

{{

Now in managed nodes .....
#useradd devops
#passwd devops
Now, make entry in sudoers file.
#cd /etc/sudoers.d/
#vim devops
devops   ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD: ALL

}}

Again in controlled node.
#ssh-copy-id -i devops@<managed_node_IP>or <managed_node_HOSTNAME>
