Say, You  have mentioned variable in playbook yaml file
like ..

vars:
    mydir: /tmp/dir1
    myfile: /etc/fstab 
    mypkg: 
     - httpd
     - nfs-utils
     - tree
     - samba
and you are also providing same variable in command prompt while
running playbook then , it will give priority of command prompt.
Mentioned variable while running playbook. Like below

# ansible-playbook <playbook_name>.yml -e mydir=/tmp/dir2 -e myfile=
/etc/group -e mypkg=httpd,nfs-utils,samba, tree

if vars and var_files are in playbook then it will give priority of 
var_files


#mkdir /myvariables
#cd /myvariables
#vim var.yml
mydir: /tmp/dir1
myfile: /etc/fstab
mypkg: 
  - httpd
  - nfs-utils
  - tree
  - samba


- hosts: all
  vars_files:
   - /myvariables/var.yml
  tasks:
  - name: "This is Going to create Directory name of {{ mydir }}"
      file:
        path: "{{ mydir }}" 
        state: directory
  - copy:
      src: "{{ myfile }}"
      dest: "{{ mydir }}"
      owner: faruk
      group: faruk
      mode: 750
   - yum:
         name: "{{ mypkg }}"
         state: latest
