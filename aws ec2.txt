#pip install boto
#pip install --upgrade pip

To launch an Instance.
- hosts: localhost

{{The localhost will got to boto3 , then boto3 will forward to aws.}}
  tasks:
  - ec2:
       aws_access_key: take from aws ac
       aws_secret_key: take from aws ac
       key_name: take from aws ac
       group: create sg aws ac (give only name)
       instance_type: t2.micro
       image: take from aws ac
       wait: yes
       count: 1
       wait_timeout: 500
       instance_tags:
             Name: Prod-Instance
       monitoring: yes
       region: ap-south-1
       vpc_subnet_id: take from aws ac

add localhost in hosts ansible file.

#ansible-playbook <playbook>.yml

vpc_subnet_id should be same to stop & start.

To stop :-
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
  - ec2:
       aws_access_key: take from aws ac
       aws_secret_key: take from aws ac
       instance_ids:  take from aws ac
       region: ap-south-1
       state: stopped
       wait: True
       vpc_subnet_id: take from aws ac
       assign_public_ip: no
    
#ssh-copy-id -i root@localhost
