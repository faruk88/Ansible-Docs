web and app should be entry in inventory file.
say, inventory file location is /etc/ansible/hosts

[web]
192.168.1.20   mydir=/tmp/faruk  myfile=/etc/group
[app]
192.168.1.30  mydir=/tmp/abdullah  myfile=/etc/gshadow

[web:vars]
mydir=/tmp/dir1
myfile=/etc/passwd
mypkg=httpd,nfs-utils,samba,tree

[app:vars]
mydir=/tmp/dir2
myfile=/etc/shadow
mypkg=httpd,nfs-utils,samba,tree

It will group give priority of host base,
not hostgroup variables

- hosts: all 
   tasks:
   - name: "This task will create {{ mydir }}"
      file: 
        path: "{{ mydir }}"
        state: directory
   - name: "This task will copy {{ myfile}} to {{ mydir }}"
      copy:
          src: "{{ myfile }}"
          dest: "{{ mydir }}"
          owner: faruk
          group: faruk
          mode: 750
   - name: "This will install packages {{ mypkg }}" 
     yum: 
        name: "{{ mypkg }}"
        state: latest
