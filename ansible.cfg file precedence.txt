Environment variables have a higher precedence than entries in ansible.cfg.

If 2) 3) 4) is mentioned but ANSIBLE_CONFIG set then it will take priority
1) ANSIBLE_CONFIG (environment variable if set)

If 1) is not set then it will search in current working directory (pwd)
2) ansible.cfg (in the current directory)

If 1) and 2) is not set, It will search in the home directory of user(by which user you logged in)
3) ~/.ansible.cfg (in the home directory)

If 1) 2) 3) not found then it will take default ansible.cfg file.
4) /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
